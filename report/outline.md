- Abstract
- Introduction
  - Problem formulation - where does the problem come from
  - Why the problem is important
  - What's been done
  - what we want to do
- Background
  - Social Networks
  - Dynamics on graphs
  - Clustering on graphs
    - Markov Clustering
  - Clustering on social networks
  <!--This part would need to be the most extensible-->
- Method
  - Initialising the graphs
  - Iterating the graphs over time
  - Clustering the graphs
  - Extracting Information out of the graphs
  **Why do we choose these approaches?**
- Results
  <!--or do I put the extracting of the information here?-->
- Discussion
  - Why did we see the dynamics that we did?
  - Do the results reflect what we see in real life?
  - Do the results reflect what we see in published research?
  - What mechanisms could have been accounted for to induce the behaviour we wanted?  <!--is that actually a question we ask?-->
  - What could be done differently?
- Conclusion
  - What we set out to accomplish
  - What we found
  - How the results differed from our expectations
  - What could be done differently in the future
