# Introduction

## Context
Having friends is important.
- to resolve issues
- isolation can lead people to insanity
- even social isolation can have the same effect on the brain as physical pain
- What has been done in the field in broad strokes

<!--examples in industry
- Facebook's recommender
- Amazon's recommender
- Ads
- Help in psychology

<!--What's been done in the research so far and why there is a gap-->

<!--
The research can be grouped by these three sections:
- Initialisations of the networks:
  - How the initialised networks imitate the static snapshots of real-life social networks
  - The ease of visualisations of these networks
  - how different network generators can model different kinds of real-life networks
  - The performance characteristics of these networks
  - whether some networks can be approximated by other methods
- Clustering the graphs:
  - local vs global
  - agglomerative vs hierarchical
  - K-Means
  - markov clustering
- Changing the network over time
  - how relationships change over time
  - what we think of the opinions of others
-->

<!--this might be a bit much
rather go at it from the point of view of what has been done in the literature to model the phenomenon
-->

## Need
- Why is what I am doing a gap?

## Task
- What we aim to do in the paper

In this work we aim to model a dynamic social network over time and learn how the naturally forming social groups change over time

## Preview

In this project we aim to see how the size of social networks change over time.
