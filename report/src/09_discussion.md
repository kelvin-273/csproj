# Discussion

From the visualisations we can see that rather than the edge weights stabilising toward
the mean value of the network, we see that the final result has edge weights that lean toward the extremes with most edges in the final visualisation being a bold red or blue representing very close or distant relationships. In the plots for the cluster sizes and the plots for the number of people entering and leaving the clusters see a large amount of volatility, within the clusters for the entire time period being simulated. This could be due to the changes occurring in discrete time steps. This could also be due to how much weight is given to the mutual opinions. When we introduce a dampening factor to the mutual connections we begin to see convergent steady-state behaviour.

In future research, it would be worthwhile to explore the interplay between this how the discretisation of these network dynamics affect the steady-state behaviour and perhaps provide a rigorous theoretical approach to understanding this phenomena. It would also be interesting to introduce random noise to the system and explore the impact of different kinds and different degrees of noise on the steady-state behaviour. This model was only tested on networks of with $100$ nodes and $10$ edges per node on average. Future research may also look into parallelising the network and exploring the dynamics on networks of bigger size and more edges per node. In this model, people on the network only ever interact with people that they know and never meet new people. Future models may experiment with adaptive edge strategies where edges are added and removed from the network to model the meeting of new people and the forgetting of old people.

# Conclusion

In this project we simulated a social network of where the relationship a person has with someone is subject to change by the mutual relationships between them and asked how the naturally occurring social groups within that network change over time. The empirical results obtained in this experiment showed that for large networks, the social groups that emerge over time display non-convergent behavior. More research need to be done to identify under what conditions convergent steady-state behaviour emerges and what relationships might exist between network size, average degree, mutual opinion and network volatility.
