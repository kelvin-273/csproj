We, as humans are social creatures, that depend on our relationships with others to function in civilised society. In this project we explore the dynamics of the naturally emerging social groups when social pressure is applied to the individuals in the social network. We show that the stability of our groups is largely dependent on how readily our opinions of others are swayed by others.
